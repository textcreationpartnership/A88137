            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A briefe Relation of the Life and Converſation of JACOB BOEHMEN, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by learned men called TEUTONICUS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ACOB BOEHMEN was borne in the yeare 1575. at old <hi>Seidenberg,</hi> about two miles diſtant from <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> a City lying in Upper <hi>Luſatia,</hi> which is commended in the Writings of learned men: His parents were <hi>Jacob</hi> his father, and <hi>Urſula</hi> his mother, both poore country people. In his youth he kept cattell, and afterwards by the counſell of his friends was ſent to Schoole, where he gate to learne to write and reade to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the feare of God, and after that was put to the Trade of a Shoo-maker; wherein when he became a Maſter (<hi>Anno</hi> 1594.) he married a mayd, one <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> the daughter of one <hi>John Kunſhman</hi> of <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> a Butcher, with whom he lived peaceably and well thirty yeares, and had by her foure ſonnes, who alſo learned handicrafts.</p>
            <p>This man, being from his youth up addicted to the feare of God, and being a willing hearer of Sermons, was at length ſtirred up by that <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of our <hi>Saviours</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 11. verſ. 13. <hi>Your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that aske him for it</hi>) likewiſe
<pb facs="tcp:124471:2"/>through the differences and controverſies in <hi>Religion</hi> (in which he knew not how to ſatisfie himſelfe) was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he in the ſimplicity of ſpirit, ardently and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly asked, ſought and knocked, that he might know the <hi>Truth;</hi> whereby according to the <hi>Divine Drawing</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> hee was in ſpirit rapt into the <hi>Holy Saboath;</hi> where he remained ſeven whole daye by his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in higheſt <hi>Ioy.</hi> Afterwards, when he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and had layd aſide the folly of youth, he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Divine Zeale</hi> to reprehend very earneſtly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scandalous and Blaſphemous Speeches, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe from all unſeemly actions with earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the Love of vertue, by which practice and life, ſeeing it was cleane contrary to the way and courſe of the world, he became only their ſcorne and deriſion; in the meane time he maintained himſelfe with the labour of his hands, in the ſweat of his browes, till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Sixt Seculum</hi> namely the year 1600, when he was a ſecond time poſſeſſed with a <hi>Divine Light</hi> and by a ſudden ſight of a <hi>Pewter Veſſell</hi> he was brought to the inward ground or <hi>Centrum</hi> of the hidden <hi>Nature.</hi> But he yet ſomewhat miſtruſting, went out into an open field, and there beheld the <hi>Wonder-workes</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Signatures of all created things, very cleerly and manifeſtly laid open: whereupon he was taken with exceeding <hi>Ioy,</hi> yet held his peace in ſilence, praiſed God, and in the meane time contented himſelfe therewith.</p>
            <p>But according to Gods holy counſell, who manageth his work in ſecret, after ten yeares, <hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1610. through the <hi>Overſhadowing</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> he was a third time touched by God and renewed. Whereupon, when hee became ſo enlightned, leſt ſo great grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, ſhould ſlip out of his memory, or he
<pb facs="tcp:124471:3"/>reſiſt his God, he wrote privately and ſecretly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by ſmall meanes, and no bookes at all but only the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> Theſe Workes following, <hi>viz.</hi>
